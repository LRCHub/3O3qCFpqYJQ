If the sky should
fall into the sea
And the stars fade
all around me
All the times
That we have known here
I will sing
A hymn to love...
We have lived and dreamed
we two alone
In a world,
thats been our very own
With its memories
Ever grateful
Just for you, I sing
A hymn to love...
I remember each embrace
And the smile
that lights your face
And my heart begins to sing...
Your eyes no lied
And my heart begins to sing
Oh my heart begins to sing...
If one day you should ever
Disappear
If one day you should ever
Disappear
These words...
If one day we had to
say goodbye
And our love should
fade away and die
In my heart
You will remain here
And I'll sing
A hymn to love...
Oh for love, we live eternally
In the blue,
where all is harmony
With each day
We are in heaven
As for you, I'll sing
A hymn to love...
As for you, I'll sing
A hymn to love...
