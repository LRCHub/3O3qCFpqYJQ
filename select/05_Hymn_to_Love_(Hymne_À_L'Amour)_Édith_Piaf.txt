If the sky should fall into the sea
And the stars fade all around me
For the times that we have known here
I will sing a hymn to love

We have lived and dreamed, we two alone
In a world that seemed our very own
With it's memory ever grateful
Just for you, I'll sing a hymn to love

I remember each embrace
The smile that lights your face
And my heart begins to sing
Your arms, the hands secure
Your eyes that said, "Be sure"
And my heart begins to sing

If one day we had to say goodbye
And our love were to fade away and die
In my heart you will remain dear
I will sing a hymn to love

Those who love will live eternally
In the blue, where all is harmony
With my voice raised high to heaven
Just for you, I'll sing a hymn to love
