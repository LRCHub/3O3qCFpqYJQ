```lrc
[00:12.02] If the sky should fall into the sea
[00:19.02] And the stars fade all around me
[00:26.08] All the times that we have known here
[00:35.28] I will sing a hymn to love
[00:48.28] 
[00:40.60] We have lived and dreamed we two alone
[00:45.70] In a world that's been our very own
[00:51.86] With it's memories ever grateful
[00:58.43] Just for you I sing a hymn to love
[01:15.43] 
[01:12.06] I remember each embrace
[01:15.52] The smile that lights your face
[01:19.05] And my heart begins to sing
[01:24.65] Your eyes have never lied
[01:30.38] And my heart begins to sing
[01:37.47] And my heart begins to sing
[01:50.97] 
[02:05.06] If one day you should ever disappear
[02:27.27] Always remember these words
[02:33.56] If one day we had to say goodbye
[02:39.52] And our love should fade away and die
[02:46.01] In my heart you will remain here
[02:49.05] And I'II sing a hymn to love
[03:03.05] 
[02:50.14] O for love, we live eternally
[02:52.18] In the blue we'll roll this harmony
[02:54.05] With every day we are in heaven
[02:54.69] As for you, I'll sing a hymn to love
[03:12.69] 
[02:55.82] Don't you ever worry, dear
[02:56.68] And the stars shall fade from the sky
[02:57.63] All the times that we have known here
[02:58.28] I will sing a hymn to our love
[03:08.05] Oh darling,
[03:12.63] Just for you I sing
[03:14.47] A hymn to love
